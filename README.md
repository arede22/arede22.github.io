## Personal Website/Portfolio

1. Demonstrating HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills
2. Created using React.js application launched with Next for static website

Recently changed:
  Added some React components for abstractions (look up state, props, and lifecycle if needed at that time)
  Updated jsx to wrappers/styles in styled-components to ready for abstractions
  Need to update jsx to wrappers/styles for modals so need to figure out modals
Yet to-do:
  Change px to em
  Figure out modals
  Add in a 'scroll to top' button
  Sketch out a good scheme for design, now that abstractions are done everything should go smoother
  Graphic design for background
  Animation gif for loading screen

Updating project:
  1. Launch via CLI:
    npm run build
    npm run export
    cd out
    serve -p 8080
  2. Running into node module issues on build, if solving takes too long do:
    npm uninstall
    delete .next
    delete node_modules
    delete package_lock.json
    npm install
    and launch the application
  3. To do:
    Style components compartmentally
    See if necessary to incorporate react-dom, react-router, react bootstrap, etc.
    Javascript and Ajax scripts
    Add in API calls
    Page loader
    Make compatible with different media
